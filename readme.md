For future update ideas:

Progressive Tax System 
    Add tax deductions or breaks for certain expenses or charitable actions (like donating to the community center).

Monthly Tax Statements
    Provide players with a breakdown of their taxes at the end of each in-game month. This could include:
        Revenue Breakdown: How much was taxed from different categories (e.g., crops, artisan goods, animal products).
        Expenses: Taxable deductions based on upgrades, maintenance costs for buildings, or animal care.

Dynamic Tax Rates
    Make tax rates depend on in-game factors:
        Seasonal Variations: Lower taxes in winter when productivity is lower.
        Local Governance: Allow players to influence the rates by befriending certain NPCs (e.g., Lewis).

Critical :
    Create a plan forward to develop the mod
        Tax System

        Currently, the tax system is counted directly everytime a player shipped items through shipping bin. The tax
        rate is counted from how many buildings, animals and years has passed. 

        My current plan is to make 2 tax systems. Assets and product. Asset system is a tax system based on how much
        Assets you got like buildings and animals. These buildings/animals will be taxed at the end of every season based on a percentage
        of the building's price.

        The second one is product. where it's tax according to like product category and its quality. This needs more research.

        Reward system

        The reward system will be implemented when the tax system is final.



Current goal:
    Tax based on season : 
    Save Progression per save : OK
    Think about a reward system :

Things Done :
    Introduce a tax rate that increases with the player's wealth or income. :
        building : OK
        animals : OK
        current year : OK
        tillable area : ???
    Add configuration file : OK
    Add GMCM Support : OK
