For future update ideas:

Progressive Tax System 
    Add tax deductions or breaks for certain expenses or charitable actions (like donating to the community center).

Monthly Tax Statements
    Provide players with a breakdown of their taxes at the end of each in-game month. This could include:
        Revenue Breakdown: How much was taxed from different categories (e.g., crops, artisan goods, animal products).
        Expenses: Taxable deductions based on upgrades, maintenance costs for buildings, or animal care.

Dynamic Tax Rates
    Make tax rates depend on in-game factors:
        Seasonal Variations: Lower taxes in winter when productivity is lower.
        Local Governance: Allow players to influence the rates by befriending certain NPCs (e.g., Lewis).

Current goal:
    Introduce a tax rate that increases with the player's wealth or income. :
        building : OK
        animals : OK
        current year : OK
        tillable area : ???
    Add configuration file : OK
    Add GMCM Support : OK
    Tax based on season :
