A tax mod to reduce items price sold through the shipping bin according to 3 factors :
1. How many buildings
2. How many animals
3. How many years has passed

Each factor can be configured through MCM or stright to config.json (if you want some crazy values).

Current goal :
	Implement mailing for future reward system.

Don't want to take things too complicated. This is my first mod. Do things bit by bit.

2 main systems :
1. Tax system (considered done albeit simple one)
2. Reward system (On progress)
